# Vim Reference Guide

**Vim Reference Guide** is intended as a concise learning resource for beginner to intermediate level Vim users. It has more in common with cheatsheets than a typical text book. Topics like Regular Expressions and Macros have more detailed explanations and examples due to their complexity. Visit https://youtu.be/SyQe6zzOGZ0 for a short video about the book.

See [Version_changes.md](./Version_changes.md) to keep track of changes made to the book.

üìπ I'm currently [creating short 1-10 minute videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTv2U3HnAL4NN2tK-59ZiNBm-o64-Yvos) highlighting handy Vim features.

# Testimonials

Got several suggestions and feedback when [my submission about this book](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30684232) reached the front page of Hacker News.

>Great job on this! ‚Äî rendall

>Hi, great work releasing this! Trying to explain vim concisely is always an interesting challenge and I had a great time reading your attempt in this book. I always find it really interesting on how people try to group certain vim functions in a way that makes sense to people that don't use vim. I think you cover that idea pretty well in your 'Vim philosophy and features' section whilst not making it overly abstract and keeping it relatable. ‚Äî doix

>Neat stuff! One piece of feedback is that I would include "+p and "+yy in the copy and paste section. ‚Äî mrpotato

>I learnt regular expression by reading your books, thank you for the great work. ‚Äî LamJH
