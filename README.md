# Vim Reference

⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ This is a **work-in-progress** reference guide for the Vim text editor, suitable for beginner to intermediate level users. The content here was originally written for `version 7.4` and I will be updating the material for `version 8+`.

ℹ️ See also my [curated list on Vim](https://learnbyexample.github.io/curated_resources/vim.html) for beginner to advanced level resources.
