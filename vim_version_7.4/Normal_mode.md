### <a name="word-and-character-based-move"></a>Word and Character based move

Difference between word and WORD (definitions quoted from `:h word`)

> **word** A word consists of a sequence of letters, digits and underscores, or a sequence of other non-blank characters, separated with white space (spaces, tabs, <EOL>).  This can be changed with the 'iskeyword' option.  An empty line is also considered to be a word.

> **WORD** A WORD consists of a sequence of non-blank characters, separated with white space.  An empty line is also considered to be a WORD.

**Word based move**

* `w` move to start of next **word** (192.1.168.43 requires multiple `w` movements)
* `W` move to start of next **WORD** (192.1.168.43 requires one `W` movement)
* `b` move to beginning of current **word** if cursor is not at start of **word** or beginning of previous **word**
* `B` move to beginning of current **WORD** if cursor is not at start of **WORD** or beginning of previous **WORD**
* `e` move to end of current **word** if cursor is not already at end of **word** or end of next **word**
* `E` move to end of current **WORD** if cursor is not already at end of **WORD** or end of next **WORD**

**Character based move**

* `f(` move forward in the current line to next occurrence of character (
* `fb` move forward in the current line to next occurrence of character b
* `3f"` move forward to third occurrence of character " in current line

* `Fa` move backward in the current line to character a
* `Ta` move backward in the current line to character just after a
* `;` repeat previous `f,F,t,T` movement in forward direction

Vim has special purpose registers with pre-defined behavior

    * Useful for this sequence: yanking content, deleting something and then pasting yanked content using `"0p`
* `"1` to `"9` deleted contents are stored in these registers and get shifted with each new deletion. `"1` has the most recently deleted content
    * `"2p` paste content deleted before the last deletion
* `"+` this register stores system clipboard contents
    * `gg"+yG` copy entire file contents to clipboard
    * `"+p` paste content from clipboard

### <a name="context-editing"></a>Context editing

We have seen movement using `w,%,f` etc. They require precise positioning to be effective. Vim provides a way to modify commands that accepts movement like `y,c,d` to recognize context. These are `i` and `a` text object selections - easy way to remember their subtle differences is to think of `i` as **inner** and `a` as **around**

* `diw` delete a word regardless of where the cursor is on that word. Equivalent to using `de` when cursor is on first character of the word
* `diW` delete a WORD regardless of where the cursor is on that word
* `daw` delete a word regardless of where the cursor is on that word and a space character to left/right of the word depending on its position as part of sentence
* `dis` delete a sentence regardless of where the cursor is on that sentence
* `yas` copy a sentence regardless of where the cursor is on that sentence and a space left/right
* `cip` delete a paragraph regardless of where the cursor is on that paragraph and change to Insert mode
* `di"` delete all characters within pair of double quotes, regardless of where cursor is within quotes
* `da'` delete all characters within pair of single quotes as well as the quotes
* `ci(` delete all characters within () and change to Insert mode. Works even if matching parenthesis are spread over multiple lines
* `ya}` copy all characters within {} including the {}. Works even if matching braces are spread over multiple lines
